### 5. Simplified Architecture

- Clean, maintainable codebase

## System Structure
```
Management Portal:
├── Dashboard (overview stats)
├── Manage Lecturers (add, bulk upload, status toggle)
├── Manage Students (add, bulk upload, search, filter)
├── Manage Courses (add, search, status toggle)
└── Manage Subjects (add, filter by course, status toggle)
```

## Database Models
- **Course**: 3-year programs with subjects
- **Subject**: Linked to courses, years (1-3), semesters (1-6)
- **Student**: Enrolled in courses, tracked by academic year
- **Lecturer**: Can be assigned to subjects
- **Management**: Admin users

## Next Steps (if needed)
1. Add lecturer-subject assignment functionality
2. Add student enrollment in subjects
3. Add attendance and marks management
4. Add reporting features

The system is now clean, modern, and focused on essential college management functionality.
