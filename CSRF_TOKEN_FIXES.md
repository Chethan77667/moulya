# CSRF Token Fixes Summary

## Issue
The application was showing "Bad Request - The CSRF token is missing" errors on login and logout operations.

## Root Cause
Flask-WTF CSRF protection was enabled in the application, but several forms were missing the required CSRF tokens:

1. Login forms (management and lecturer)
2. Logout forms across all templates
3. Change password form
4. Some lecturer forms (attendance, marks, student management)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Login Forms
- Added CSRF token to `templates/auth/management_login.html`
- Added CSRF token to `templates/auth/lecturer_login.html`

### 2. Logout Forms
Updated all logout forms across the application to include CSRF tokens:
- Management templates: dashboard, courses, students, subjects, reports, lecturers, bulk_credentials
- Lecturer templates: dashboard, subjects, marks, attendance, reports, marks_deficiency, subject_students, attendance_shortage

### 3. Change Password Form
- Added CSRF token to `templates/auth/change_password.html`

### 4. Lecturer Forms
- Added CSRF tokens to attendance recording forms
- Added CSRF tokens to marks entry forms
- Added CSRF tokens to student management forms

## Technical Details

### CSRF Token Implementation
```html
<input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="{{ csrf_token() }}"/>
```

### Flask Configuration
The application already had CSRF protection properly configured in `app.py`:
```python
csrf = CSRFProtect(app)

@app.context_processor
def inject_csrf_token():
    from flask_wtf.csrf import generate_csrf
    return dict(csrf_token=generate_csrf)
```

## Files Modified
- `templates/auth/management_login.html`
- `templates/auth/lecturer_login.html`
- `templates/auth/change_password.html`
- `templates/management/dashboard.html`
- `templates/management/courses.html`
- `templates/management/students.html`
- `templates/management/subjects.html`
- `templates/management/reports.html`
- `templates/management/lecturers.html`
- `templates/management/bulk_credentials.html`
- `templates/lecturer/dashboard.html`
- `templates/lecturer/subjects.html`
- `templates/lecturer/marks.html`
- `templates/lecturer/attendance.html`
- `templates/lecturer/reports.html`
- `templates/lecturer/marks_deficiency.html`
- `templates/lecturer/subject_students.html`
- `templates/lecturer/attendance_shortage.html`

## Result
All forms now include proper CSRF tokens, which should resolve the "CSRF token is missing" errors during login and logout operations.

## Testing
After applying these fixes:
1. Login should work without CSRF errors
2. Logout should work without CSRF errors
3. All form submissions should work properly
4. CSRF protection remains active for security
